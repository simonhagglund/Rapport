\subsection{Control Theory}
Control theory deals with dynamic continuous systems and their control. Control theory as a subject is taught in various programmes at Chalmers. The computer science students of Chalmers are taught control theory in their third year in the course \course{Control theory}{Reglerteknik}{ERE103}.

Although Control theory as a subject is relatively new, the techniques therein have been used for a long time. The Romans used control theory to control the water levels in their aqueducts and it was later used to control the velocity of windmills \cite{ControlTheoryHistory}. Today control theory is utilised in many technical advanced systems like cell phone networks and fighter jets.

A system can be controlled be one of two basic loops. Open-loop or closed-loop. The closed-loops, or feedback-loop utilise the output of the process to control the system. The open-loop works without the use of feedback.
