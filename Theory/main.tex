\section{Theory}\label{sec:theory}

\begin{newtext}
This section provides theoretical background about \gls{DSL}s, \gls{controltheory} and its Chalmers course \gls{ERE103}, as well as some didactic theory which is used in order to improve the effectiveness of teaching in the learning material. 
\end{newtext}

\iffalse
The theory needed for the product of this project consists of four parts. 

First some basic information on \gls{ERE103}; Chalmers' course on \gls{controltheory}.  

Second a rundown on \gls{DSL}s; the main tool with which the project was created.

Third is a section on \gls{controltheory} itself; the main subject of the project.

Finally, there is a section on \gls{didactic}s; providing some valuable insight into how to design effective teaching material.
%% It also contains a brief high level description of \gls{controltheory}.

%This section contains explanations and examples of some core concepts of the project such as domain-specific languages and \gls{controltheory}. It also present some background of the course \gls{ERE103} which is the target of this projects learning material.
