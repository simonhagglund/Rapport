Haskell is a language that is popular to use for embedded domain-specific languages. 
As has been previously investigated, domain-specific languages can benefit those with background knowledge in programming to understand concepts and relations in other disciplines---specifically those related to mathematical domains.
Courses on control theory at CTH have a reputation of being notoriously difficult for students, and many of these courses have a low pass rate. 
%This project investigates how to use (embedded) domain-specific languages with Haskell in creating supplementary course material for a select few essential areas. 
This project aims to produce supplementary learning material for a select few essential areas in control theory using embedded domain-specific languages.
