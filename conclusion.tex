\section{Conclusion}

%Inom Slutsats/diskussion ska ett avsnitt inkluderas där gruppen reflekterar kring behovet av ytterligare kunskap och ger förslag till framtida problemställningar inom ämnet. 

In this report we have presented the learning material we have developed as a supplementary aid for the Control theory course ERE103. The methodology that is used in this learning material is the use of domain specific languages and haskell which hopefully will help the students in their learning of the material. Due to time constraints the product has not been tested on any students but we have presented a strong foundation in previous science that suggest that this approach is favourable. We propose a future project can be performed that tests the effect it has on students learning. Other projects that use the same theories as we have used should also be useful and can be used to develop similar materials in either other subjects or as a continuation of our project.
